### The binary features extracted from Malimg dataset with horizontal-edge.

 - f1_fam_n_features: m-by-n list
     - m is the number of samples in family n
     - n is the length of the selected feature(256)
 - f1_all_features: dictionary 
     - the key is the family name and 
     - the value is the feature set in the form of m-by-n list
 - f1_all_families_weight: c-by-n ndarray
     - this represents the dimension weight in Linear SVM
     - c is the number of classifiers. (25 classes have 300 classifiers)
     - n is the length of the selected feature
 - f1_reduced_mask: n-ndarray
     - a mask of selecting features by using SVM-RFE. (reduced to 169 so far)
         - n is the length of the selected feature(256)
 - prob_of_selected_fam_nfamilies
     - Contains n list. Each represents a family. Each sublist contains the probability of each sample point
       being assigned to its own family.
 - prob_of_each_sample_25families
     - Equals with prob_of_selected_fam_25families
 - prob_benignnfamilies
     - prob_benign_n_families
     - 120 * n array
     - Each row represents a benign sample. Each column represents the probability of each sample being assigned to
       each of the top n best families (different n gives different model)
     - Families are ranked based on the minimum assigning probability of each sample of its own.
 - prob_malwarenfamilies
    - prob_malware_n_families
    - m * n array
    - similar as prob_benign_n_families
 - benign_accu_rate_with_top_families
     - Equals with prob_benign25families
