### The binary features extracted from Malimg dataset with horizontal-edge.

 - f1_fam_n_features: m-by-n list
     - m is the number of samples in family n
     - n is the length of the selected feature(256)
 - f1_all_features: dictionary 
     - the key is the family name and 
     - the value is the feature set in the form of m-by-n list
 - f1_all_families_weight: c-by-n ndarray
     - this represents the dimension weight in Linear SVM
     - c is the number of classifiers. (25 classes have 300 classifiers)
     - n is the length of the selected feature
 - f1_reduced_mask: n-ndarray
     - a mask of selecting features by using SVM-RFE. (reduced to 169 so far)
         - n is the length of the selected feature(256)
