### The hashed values (secret keys) by different approaches, error-correcting, distributed source coding, multi-phase. Also stores the classification result for all 25 malware families.


 - /decode and /encode
     - each binary file represents a family and contains a list of hashed value for all samples.
     - /decode uses Hamming(7, 4) decoder with wavelet features.
     - /encode used Hamming(7, 4) encoder with frequency distribution (from DCT coefficient).

 - /decode_benign and /encode_benign
     - similar to /decode except for this is for benign samples.

 - /decode_result and /encode_result and /multiple_result
     - contains the classification result in terms of the confusion matrix.
     - multiple means using multi-phase approach.
     - cm_col_schema: the schema indicating each column.
     - cm_row_schema: the schema indicating each row.
     - cm_row: 2D confusion matrix.

- /score
	- contains the pre-generated score for each sample of the method Error-correcting (decode) and Distributed coding (encode).
	- the scoring algorithm can be found in function generate_scores().
	- /decode/exp_n_decode_m_fam
		- m indicates how many (top-performed) families are used.
		- /decode_benign_reult_i and /decode_malware_result_i
			- i indicates the ith fold (over 5-folds corss-validation)
			- malware scores (samples) are based on the using dataset which is trimmed to at most 200.
			- benign scores (samples) consist of 120 samples.
