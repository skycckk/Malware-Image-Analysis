### The hashed value produced by using Hamming(7, 4) decode. Each file(family) contains lists of hash value for each image. The hash value is also a list type of intergers.
Example:
Family Lolyda.AA1 has 200 hashed values: [[1, 2, 3, ...], [10, 30, 31, ...], ...].

Each hashed value is constructed by: 
1. Input a 2D image
2. Extract a frequency distribution by 8x8 DCT with its coefficients
3. Average each band from 64 cells
4. Get 64 bins (128 bins if the image is split to 2 horizontally)
5. Cast to DWORD (2 bytes)
6. Hamming decode(7, 4)
6. Get hashed value with length 64

----------
Load saved hashed values
    
    >> import pickle
    >> with open(<file_path>, 'rb') as fp:
    >>     data = pickle.load(fp)
