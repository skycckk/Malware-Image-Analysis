### The result of trained k value(number of clusters)

 - f1_fam_n_codebook: A codebook for each family. This represents the corresponding centroids and threshold(radius) for all possible K values.
     - dictionary of dictionary
     - key: number of clusters
       - keys of the second layer are 'centroid', 'threshold'
     - value: dictionary for the corresponding centroids and radius
       - 'centroid': k-dy-d array where k is the number of clusters
       - 'threshold': float, the threshold for determining if a sample is within this family. For example, if the computing threshold of one sample is less than this theshold, then classify it to this family.
