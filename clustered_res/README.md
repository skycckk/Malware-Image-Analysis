### The result of trained k value(number of clusters)

 - f1_fam_n_codebook: A codebook for each family. This represents the corresponding centroids and threshold(radius) for all possible K values.
     - Dictionary of dictionary
     - Key: Number of clusters
       - keys of the second layer are 'centroid', 'threshold'
     - Value: dictionary for the corresponding centroids and radius
       - 'centroid': k-dy-d array where k is the number of clusters
       - 'threshold': Float, the threshold for determining if a sample is within this family. For example, if the computing threshold of one sample is less than this theshold, then classify it to this family. This threshold is trained by taking an average samples then computing the internal distortion for all training samples in the same family. Pick 2x standard deviation as the 'radius'.
